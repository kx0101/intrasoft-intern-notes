12 Agile Principles


1) Deliver Value Faster - Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivey of valuable software.

2) Welcome Change - Welcome changes to requirements, even late in projects. Agile processes harness that change for the customer's competitive advantage

4) Work Together Daily - Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.

5) Build PRojects around Motivated Individuals - Give them the environment and support they need and trust them to get the job done.

6) Face-To-Face Conversations - The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is with face-to-face conversation.

7) Working Software is Key - Working software is the primary measure of progress.

8) Sustainable Development - Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, project team members (deveoeprs), and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

9) Attention to Technical Excellence - Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.

10) Simplicity - The art of maximizing the amount of work not done is essential.

11) Self-Organizing Teams - The best architectures, requierments, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
